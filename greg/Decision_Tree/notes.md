## Decision Tree Classification

The Objective of the classification is simple predict the desired class based on features, this is the same as all
other models within the problem set for the other methods implemented. Just like the other implemented algorithms in this study.
however this model is a white box model. in that it shared the decision making logic, this is not the same as the 
neural network which is considered a black box model such as a neural network. and it's training is considered much faster compared 
to the neural network.

however unlike bayes methods of SVM there are not weighted probablities making this model and implementation
distribution-free also termed non-parametric. Because of their simple implemenation they're often a great starting model to understand machine learning.

by building the decision tree the items used for classification are split based on certain criterium. This 
Trees learn decisions based on if-else about individual features.
