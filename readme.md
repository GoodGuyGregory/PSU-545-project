# Diesease Detection with Various Machine Learning Algorithms

## Abstract 

Various methods have been used to track metrics falsely through Elizabeth Holmes, from back in the 1980s to modern day medical facilities. This study was conducted on a data set containing... The features included within this data set cover .... These features can be correlated to result in various medical diagnoses. The main focus of this project is to utilize the provided data in order to allow for a best fit model analysis. Determining from the related material we have studied this quarter within PSU to use our prior knowledge to hypothesize which will perform the best and determine if our assumptions were accurate when the model is trained and tested against the same data set through all machine learning algorithms. The analysis of our findings is summarized within the final sections of this report. Each Model will feature a breakdown of the challenges for each paradigm and the resulting loss metrics, and hyper parameters available to stretch a maximum accuracy against the training and test sets.

**Models Implemented and Trained**

* Multi-Layer-Perceptron (Neural Network)
* Decision Tree Classifier
